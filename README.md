# Aphrodite Terminal Theme

A minimalistic terminal theme (prompt) that does not have any visual noise. Displays only the necessary information: virtual env, current user, hostname, working directory, and git branch if exists. Looks great both with dark and white terminals. Bash, fish and zsh are supported.
